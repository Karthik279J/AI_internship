# AI & Machine Learning Portfolio: From Foundations to Applications

This repository is a comprehensive collection of my work in Artificial Intelligence, spanning across data analysis, classical machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision.
The repository is organized into four core modules, each focusing on a specific domain of AI development.
### 1. Computer Vision (CV)
Focused on real-time image processing and facial recognition using OpenCV and deep learning frameworks.
* **Key Features:** Face detection and recognition pipelines, real-time object detection, and automated dataset collection scripts.
* **Tech Stack:** Python, OpenCV, Keras, YAML.
* **Highlights:** Implementation of custom training scripts for facial models and shape detection.
### 2. Supervised Learning
A deep dive into predictive modeling using classical statistical algorithms.
* **Models implemented:** * **Random Forest & Decision Trees:** Comparative analysis for classification tasks.
    * **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Implementation for pattern recognition.
    * **Support Vector Classification (SVC):** Optimized for high-dimensional data.
* **Tech Stack:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter Notebooks.
### 3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
End-to-end text processing and sentiment analysis.
* **Key Features:** * **Text Preprocessing:** Tokenization, Stemming, and Lemmatization pipelines.
    * **Sentiment Analysis:** Building models to classify user reviews and text sentiment.
    * **Summarization:** Automated text summarization techniques.
* **Tech Stack:** NLTK, Spacy, Pandas.
### 4. Python for AI & Data Analysis
The foundational layer containing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and core AI logic.
* **Key Projects:**
    * **Healthcare Analytics:** Heart Disease and Diabetes prediction models.
    * **Business Intelligence:** Sales data analysis (Balaji Fast Food & Cafe datasets).
    * **EDA:** Comprehensive data cleaning and visualization for Instagram and Iris datasets.
* **Tech Stack:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Python 3.x.
